## Module Challenge 1 - Refactoring

This challenge was to add meaningful HTML semantic elements as well as increase the accessibility of this website.

To accomplish this I added five semantic elements to the main HTML file

* header
* main
* section
* aside
* fotter

Additionally I added alt text to each image to make them interpretable to screenreaders

To ensure semantic items formatted correctly, I also edited the display qualities of the aside and section selectors in the CSS file
